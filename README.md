# Welcome to my first module!
###### (This is completely pointless really)
This module, VariableTypeFunctions....
```py
# designed to be imported like
import VariableTypeFunctions as vtf
from VariableTypeFunctions import *
```
....has multiple functions that work with variable types is wholly unnecessary and is mainly for aesthetic purposes <br>
- `checktype("example", str)` over `return type("example") is str` <br>
